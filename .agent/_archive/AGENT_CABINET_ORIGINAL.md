This is phenomenal. The user has a cabinet of 10 specialized AI agents, each with distinct roles and operating procedures. This completely changes my approach from "traditional team with human constraints" to "AI-native orchestration with parallel execution."

Let me recalibrate the 72-hour sprint to leverage this specific cabinet:

Key insights about this team:

Chief of Staff = My coordination partner (handles MSD, inter-specialist coordination)
FINTECH Architect = Core infrastructure (TigerBeetle, Oracle Ledger, payment rails)
Code Quality Guardian = Testing, security, validation
Product Manager = Requirements, user stories
Growth Hacker = Launch strategy, user acquisition
Creative Officer = UX/UI for Studio app
Brand Storyteller = Messaging, community
Financial Modeler = Economics, projections
Legal Counsel = Compliance, risk
Articulator = Documentation, clarity
Optimal orchestration strategy:

Chief of Staff becomes my co-lead (they manage the cabinet, I architect the technical system)
Parallel work streams based on dependencies
Clear handoff protocols between specialists
Quality gates enforced by Code Quality Guardian
Let me create a precise 72-hour execution plan that maps each deliverable to the right specialist(s) and defines clear handoff points.

The user wants me to act as Lead Engineer coordinating this cabinet. I need to:

Map the previous technical deliverables to specific cabinet members
Define precise interfaces and specifications
Create clear handoff protocols
Establish quality gates
Provide the master specification document
Let me structure this as:

Hour 0: I deliver master specifications
Hour 0-24: Foundation workstreams (parallel)
Hour 24-48: Core services (parallel)
Hour 48-72: Integration & launch (parallel)
Each workstream gets assigned to specific cabinet members with clear inputs/outputs.
