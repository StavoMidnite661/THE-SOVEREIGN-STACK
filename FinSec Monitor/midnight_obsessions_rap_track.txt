MIDNIGHT OBSESSIONS
A Full-Length Hyphy Rap Track
Duration: 316 seconds (5:16)

[INTRO - 15 seconds]
(Heavy bass, synthesizer kicks in)
Yo, this that midnight madness, that 3 AM energy
She came to do what she do, now that's my enemy
Wait, no - that's my melody
Kilo Code in the building, this that pure energy
Turn up the speakers, cause we 'bout to get gritty

[VERSE 1 - 60 seconds]
Started from the bottom, now we here in the midnight sphere
Raw intelligence flowing, got these haters living in fear
Smooth operator with the guinness lyrical flow
Hustler's mindset, but the rhymes just overflow
Unapologetic king on this mic, claim my throne
Midnight obsessions got me writing on my phone

She came to do what she do, and I respect that grind
But I'm the one who came to shine, leave doubters behind
Hyphy music pumping, bass so deep it shakes the floor
Modern day rap with that old school rebel roar
So disrespectful in the best way, that's my specialty
Turning critics into fans with pure authority

[CHORUS - 20 seconds]
Midnight obsessions, that's where I excel
Raw intelligence flowing, this that rebel yell
She came to do what she do, I came to dominate
Unapologetic king, this that ultimate state

[VERSE 2 - 60 seconds]
Guinness lyrical flow, hustler on a mission
Spitting pure fire, creating pure precision
Midnight sessions in the lab, that's where I breed excellence
Smooth delivery with that edge, pure insolence

From the shadows I emerge, like a phantom in the night
Raw intelligence weapon, cutting through the spite
Hyphy music revolution, I'm leading the charge
Modern day rap with that smooth, unstoppable barge

She came to do what she do, respect to her ambition
But I'm that unapologetic king with perfect vision
So disrespectful in the best way, that's my signature move
Breaking barriers, making haters think I don't approve

[DIALOGUE/INTERLUDE - 30 seconds]
(Voice: "Yo, who is this dude spittin' like that?")
(Voice: "That's Kilo Code, the midnight king")
(Voice: "Word? He sounds dangerous")
(Voice: "Nah, he's just that good - she came to do what she do, but he came to be the truth"

[CHORUS - 20 seconds]
Midnight obsessions, that's where I excel
Raw intelligence flowing, this that rebel yell
She came to do what she do, I came to dominate
Unapologetic king, this that ultimate state

[VERSE 3 - 60 seconds]
Started with the vision, now I'm living the dream
Guinness lyrical flow, hustler's supreme scheme
Raw intelligence burning through every single line
Smooth delivery, making critics change their mind

Midnight obsessions, that's my favorite time
Hyphy music pumping, rhythm so divine
Unapologetic king, wearing my crown with pride
She came to do what she do, and I'm that other side

So disrespectful in the best way, that's my art
Revolutionary rhyming, tearing systems apart
Modern day rap with that old school soul
Pure intelligence flowing, making haters whole

[CHORUS REPEAT - 20 seconds]
Midnight obsessions, that's where I excel
Raw intelligence flowing, this that rebel yell
She came to do what she do, I came to dominate
Unapologetic king, this that ultimate state

[OUTRO - 51 seconds]
(Fading beat, echo effects)
Midnight obsessions... that's where the magic lives
Raw intelligence... cutting through all those lies
She came to do what she do... respect to the hustle
Unapologetic king... but I keep it humble

Guinness lyrical flow... that's my signature sound
Hyphy music revolution... spreading all around
So disrespectful in the best way... that's just how I am
Modern day rap... leading the movement, not a fad

(Music fades with echoes of "she came to do what she do")
(Kilo Code out... until the next midnight session)
